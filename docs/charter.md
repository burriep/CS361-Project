## Goals:
1. To work well together in a professional, respectful manner and to follow this charter.
2. To distribute the workload evenly and develop a quality project worthy of an 'A' grade.
3. Gain a solid understanding of software engineering in a group setting and of the software life cycle.

## Work Norms:
1. Time commitment required by each group member: Waiting to see more of the project before we set hard times that people should be working on the project.  We will delegate tasks evenly and adjust tasks as necessary to even out the time commitment for each team member.
2. Dealing with different work habits: People can work the times that work best for their schedule as long as they communicate what their plans are to the other team members and provide estimated deadlines they set for themselves.  

## Ground Rules:
### Meetings:
1. Length of meetings: 45 minutes, if the group deems more time is required, this can be adjusted at a later time
2. Missing a meeting: Forgivable as long as good reason is provided to the other team members and the team member missing the meeting communicates with the rest of the team.  
3. Tardiness to meetings: Forgivable, as long as at least one team member is told in advance or a good reason is provided.
4. Phone use during meetings: Acceptable, but if it disrupts the meeting seriously or detracts from team members' focus, members will be asked to put their devices away.
5. Food and drink during meetings: Food and drink is acceptable as long as it does not distract from the content of the meeting.

### Group communication and interaction:
1. Regular communication: Members should communicate the status of their tasks at the meeting, before/after a lecture, and at least once sometime during the weekend between Thursday and Tuesday.  Communication can be done by phone, email, or in-person.
2. Group communication on tardiness/missed meetings and meeting information: If a group member will be late or miss a meeting, they are responsible to communicate as soon as possible to a group member that they will not be able to attend at the designated time.  Team member that missed or was late is responsible for providing update on their progress to the other team members.
3. Communication ethics: Messaging at the last possible moment should be avoided, but is better than no communication at all.
4. Group structure: All group members have equal pull in the project, with no one member in charge of the others.  Any differences will be discussed and we will attempt to reach an agreement as noted in the "Decision making" section below.
5. Decision making: Any decision about the project will be discussed between the group and decided with a majority vote.  If no majority vote can be reached, decision will be decided by a coin toss.

### Group participation and work quality
1. Group participation: Each group member is expected to contribute an approximately equal amount and participate in group decisions and discussions. If other group members feel that one member is not contributing or participating, the situation will be discussed and disiplinary procedures will be considered by the group if the problem continues.
2. Work not up to standard: If work quality is inadequate, rest of team will discuss with the member who turned in the sub-par work what action they can take to improve their work quality.  If member is having problems with their task, they should communicate with the rest of the team ASAP to ask for assistance and input. Otherwise, we will go to the TA or professor.
3. Group members unprepared: If group members are repeatedly unprepared for scheduled deadlines, they will be reported to the TA.  If team members continue to be unprepared, situation will be discussed with Mr. Hopkins.
4. Workload too heavy: If the workload is too heavy and causes quality or quantity to suffer, the workload should be redistributed amongst the team, or in extreme situations, we will go to the TA and ask for extensions. 

### Disciplinary Procedures:
1. Regarding disciplinary actions: The group will discuss problems up front and be responsible to hear out other members concerns. If the group meeting does not resolve the issues, the team will go to the TA or professor and ask them to moderate a discussion and aid in finding a solution.
2. Disciplinary Log: Severe offences will be kept track of, such as missing important deadlines and skipping meetings.
3. Minor Group Offence: They are excusable, but the offending member will be expected to perform better at risk of it turning into a consistent major offence.
4. Major Group Offence: Missing major deadlines, providing poor quality work with little communication, or a total lack of communication to the other group members will be recorded.
5. Punishment and Dismissal: If there are several major offences by a group member, the rest of the group will approach the TA and professor and seek the offending member's dismissal.
