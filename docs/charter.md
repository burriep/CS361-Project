# Group Charter: Sloth Solutions
## Meetings:
Wednesday 12:15 - 12:50 (EMS E384)

## Group Contacts:

## Goals:

## Work Norms:
1. Time commitment required by each group member: Waiting to see more of the project before we set hard times that people should be working on the project.
2. Dealing with different work habits: People can work the times that work best for them as long as they communicate what their plans are.

## Ground Rules:
### Meetings:
1. Length of meetings: 45 minutes 
2. Missing a meeting: Forgivable, but it should be for a good reason.
3. Tardiness to meetings: Forgivable, as long as someone is told in advance.
4. Phone use during meetings: Acceptable, but if it disrupts the meeting seriously, members will be asked to put their devices away.
5. Food and drink during meetings: Food and drink is acceptable as long as it does not distract from the content of the meeting.

### Group communication and interaction:
1. Regular communication: Members should communicate the status of their tasks at the meeting, before/after a lecture, and at least once sometime during the weekend between Thursday and Tuesday.
2. Group communication on tardiness/missed meetings and meeting information: If a group member will be late or miss a meeting, they are responsible to communicate as soon as possible to a group member that they will not be able to attend at the designated time.
3. Communication ethics: Messaging at the last possible moment should be avoided, but is better than no communication at all. 
4. Group structure: All group members have equal pull in the project, with no one member in charge of the others. 
5. Decision making:

### Group participation and work quality
1. Group participation: 
2. Work not up to standard: If work is inadequate, the member who did it should talk to the other members and ask for help to see if the problems can be resolved. Otherwise, we will go to the TA or professor.
3. Group members unprepared: If group members are repeatedly unprepared for scheduled deadlines, they will be reported to the TA.
4. Workload too heavy: If the workload is too heavy and causes quality or quantity to suffer, the workload should be redistributed amongst the team, or in extreme situations, we will go to the TA and ask for extensions. 

### Disciplinary Procedures:
1. Regarding disciplinary actions: The group will discuss problems up front and be responsible to hear out other members concers. If the group meeting does not resolve the issues, the team will go to the TA or professor and ask them to moderate a discussion and aid in finding a solution.
2. Disciplinary Log: Severe offences will be kept track of, such as missing important deadlines.
3. Minor Group Offence: They are excusable, but the offending member will be expected to perform better at risk of it turning into a consistent major offence.
4. Major Group Offence: Missing major deadlines, providing poor quality work with little communication, or a total lack of communication to the other group members will be recorded.
5. Punishment and Dismissal: If there are several major offences by a group member, the rest of the group will approach the TA and professor and seek the offending member's dismissal.
